# Partial Report
As of `7/2/2020` our program has grown to be capable of performing the following
tagging operations:

    - Tagging based on OCR text extraction (Courtesy of Tesseract).
    - Tagging based on finding the dominant frequency band in a given image.
    - Tagging based on average noise data.
   
Querying and addition of images to the database based on these operations are 
soon to be implemented using the new model, along the next days of 
development. New filters and tagging operations will also be implemented.
